//! Resources for managing Discord HTTP client and Rich Presence functionality.
//!
//! This module provides two main resources:
//! - `DiscordHttpResource`: For handling Discord HTTP client operations
//! - `DiscordRichPresenceRes`: For managing Discord Rich Presence integration

use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
use std::sync::Arc;

/// A Bevy resource that provides access to the Discord HTTP client.
///
/// This resource is automatically inserted into the Bevy app when using
/// `DiscordHttpPlugin`. It wraps Serenity's `Http` client in an `Arc`
/// for safe concurrent access.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use bevy_discord::res::DiscordHttpResource;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use serenity::all::Http;
///
/// let http = Arc::new(Http::new("token"));
/// let resource = DiscordHttpResource::new(http);
///
/// // Get a cloned Arc reference
/// let client = resource.client();
///
/// // Get a reference to the client
/// let client_ref = resource.client_ref();
/// ```

/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use bevy_discord::res::DiscordRichPresenceRes;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use discord_sdk::Discord;
///
/// let discord = Arc::new(Discord::new(/* ... */));
/// let resource = DiscordRichPresenceRes::new(discord);

/// let rp = resource.get_rp();
///
/// // Get a reference to the Discord client
/// let rp_ref = resource.get_rp_ref();
